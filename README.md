## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ PLEASE HELP ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

My name is Oleg, I am backend developer in civil life, opensource enthusiast (see [ireturn](https://github.com/butuzov/ireturn), [mirror](https://github.com/butuzov/mirror), [deadlinks](https://github.com/butuzov/deadlinks), and [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)), but since **25 February 2022** I joined Ukrainian Armed Froces and currently serving as infantry (combining this position with uav pilot and army documents management for platoon).  

P.S.
Thank you
