I loved to create (and to contribute) developer tooling: [linter-ireturn](https://github.com/butuzov/ireturn), [linter-mirror](https://github.com/butuzov/mirror), [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), [vscode-theme-acid](https://github.com/butuzov/vscode-theme-acid), [WordPress Plugin: Debug-Bar-Rewrite-Rules](https://github.com/butuzov/Debug-Bar-Rewrite-Rules), [Health checks: deadlinks](https://github.com/butuzov/deadlinks), [gobyexample (ukrainian)](https://github.com/butuzov/gobyexample)

But since 25th February I am at the army. You can support me directly using paypal obutuzov@gmail.com, diretly to JAR using card number `5375 4112 2007 5423` or using JAR [link](https://send.monobank.ua/jar/5hzpRhuL5r). I am also available for short term jobs (like hour a day or max 10 hours a week, limitation due I am mostly on duty whole day), drop me a line if you have anything to say. Cheers!
