## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ PLEASE HELP ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

My name is Oleg, I am backend developer in civil life, opensource enthusiast (see [ireturn](https://github.com/butuzov/ireturn), [mirror](https://github.com/butuzov/mirror), [deadlinks](https://github.com/butuzov/deadlinks), and [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)), but since **25 February 2022** I joined Ukrainian Armed Froces and currently serving as infantry (combining this position with uav pilot and army documents management for platoon).  

I am currently **fundrising** for a **batteries** for a **DJI Matrice 30T**. We need about a 8 units withc costs 2_750 USD. Please, consider donating few bucks to support lives of Ukrainian soldiers (if you can)!

You can do that via **PayPal** (obutuzov@gmail.com) or if you are Ukrainian via [**mono bank**](https://send.monobank.ua/jar/2VPBMTWDoV) (or **CC** `5375 4112 0403 4396`)

All reports I am posting at the [dou.ua](http://dou.ua/) (Developers Org Ua) [page](https://dou.ua/forums/topic/42510/) where this fundrise started.
